# Make sure you have nodejs and react installed.
# In your backend folder, rename "dotenv" file to ".env"
# Once loaded into compiler of your liking, open 2 git bash terminals
# In terminal 1, type "cd Backend", in the other, type "cd Frontend"
# In both terminals, run "npm install" to install dependencies
# Ensure you have xampp installed, click "start" next to Apache, and "start" next to MySql, and Admin on mysql
# create a new database named: "cleaning_service"
# Run the statements from the sql.txt file IN ORDER, one at a time for assured results.
# After doing that, go back to the terminals, run "npm run dev" in the backend, and "npm start" on the frontend
# You should now be good to go!
